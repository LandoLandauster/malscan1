<h1>VirusHammer Howto</h1>
The VirusHammer is a standalone tool to scan for viruses. You can select
several directories to scan and will be informed about all viruses found.
The selected directories are stored in user preferences, so they are remembered
when you restart.<br>
<h2>Necessary software</h2>
     You need an installed Java 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (JRE) 
  . Every JRE &gt;= 1.2 should be fine, but I just tested it with 1.3.1 and
1.4. You   can get it from Sun at <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">http://java.sun.com/j2se/</a>
     .<br>
<h2>Usage</h2>
With Linux (read /usr/src/linux/Documentation/java.txt) or Windows you simple
start 'PatternFinder.jar' like every other application, e.g. by single- or
double-clicking on it. You can also start it from the command line with
<pre>java -jar VirusHammer.jar<br></pre>
<h2>Getting speed</h2>
The current JRE from Sun offers two different VMs: client- and server-vm.
The client-vm has shorted startup times, but scans slower; the server-vm
has longer startup times, but scans much faster. There are scripts to start
VirusHammer using the server-vm (client-vm is default):<br>
<ul>
  <li>virushammer-server.sh (Linux)</li>
  <li>virushammer-server.bat (Windows)</li>
</ul>
The VirusHammer.jar has to reside in the same directory as the script. Both
scripts start VirusHammer like this<br>
<pre>java -server -jar VirusHammer.jar<br></pre>
